A. Pair-based Authentication scheme:

During registration user submits his password. Minimum length of the password is 8 and it can be called as secret pass. The secret pass should contain even number of characters. Session passwords are generated based on this secret pass. During the login phase, when the user enters his username an interface consisting of a grid is displayed. The grid is of size 6 x 6 and it consists of alphabets and numbers. These are randomly placed on the grid and the interface changes every time.

              Figure 2: Login interface

Figure 3 shows the login interface. User has to enter the password depending upon the secret pass. User has to consider his secret pass in terms of pairs. The session password consists of alphabets and digits

                    8 X |N |V| E U
      Figure 3: Intersection letter for the pair NI

The first letter in the pair is used to select the row and the second letter is used to select the column. The intersection letter is part of the session password. This is repeated for all pairs of secret pass. Fig 3 shows that V is the intersection symbol for the pair “NI”. The password entered by the user is verified by the server to authenticate the user. If the password is correct, the user is allowed to enter in to the system. The grid size can be increased to include special characters in the password. B. Hybrid Textual Authentication Scheme:

During registration, user should rate colors as shown in figure 4. The User should rate colors from 1 to 8 and he can remember it as “wvibgyor”. Same rating can be given to different colors. During the login phase, when the user enters his username an interface is displayed based on the colors selected by the user. The login interface consists of grid of size 8×8. This grid contains digits 1-8 placed randomly in grid cells. The interface also contains strips of colors as shown in figure 4. The color grid consists of 4 pairs of colors. Each pair of color represents the row and the column of the grid

                  W V I B G Y O R <- COLOURS
                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <- RATINGS

                  3 4 6 8 5 2 7 1 <-RATINGS

                        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
                      1 5 7 8 3 1 4 2 6

                      7 4 1 2 7 6 5 3 8
                      8 6 8 3 1 5 2 7 4
                      
                    LOGIN:
              Figure 5: Login interface

Figure 5 shows the login interface having the color grid and number grid of 8 x 8 having numbers 1 to 8 randomly placed in the grid. Depending on the ratings given to colors, we get the session password. As discussed above, the first color of every pair in color grid represents row and second represents column of the number grid. The number in the intersection of the row and column of the grid is part of the session password. Consider the figure 4 ratings and figure 5 login interfaces for demonstration. The first pair has red and yellow colors. The yellow color rating is 1 and red color rating is 2. So the first letter of session password is 3rd row and 4th column intersecting element i.e 4. The same method is followed for other pairs of colors. For figure 5 the password is “4524”. Instead of digits, alphabets can be used. For every login, both the number grid and the color grid get randomizes so the session password changes for every session.

The project’s primary goals consist of:

    A robust and effective web based online banking system.

    Extending functionality without compromising the security.

    Personal banking services that gives you complete control over all your banking demands online.

    Simple and easy user interface to work with.

Online Banking features:

    Registration for online banking by Admin.

    Adding Beneficiary account by customer.

    Transferring amount to the beneficiary added by customer.

    Staff must approve for beneficiary activation before it can be used for transferring funds.

    Customer gets to know his last login date and time each time he logs in.

    Customer can check last 10 transactions made with their account.

    Customer can check their account statement within a date range.

    Customer can request for ATM and Cheque Book.

    Staff will approve requests for ATM card and cheque book.

    Admin can add/edit/delete customer as well as staff.

    All three of them(customer, staff & admin) can change their password.

    Staff and Admin Login pages are hidden from customer for security purpose.

Security:

    The pairbased and colour based authentication saves the user from brutefource, sholdersniffing, dictionary attack and any types of keyloger software installed in the computer

    Each and every input is passed through mysql_real_escape_string() to remove special characters from the string so that user can’t submit arbitrary input. It protects from attacks like Sql Injection and Cross Site Scripting(XSS).

    Passwords are encrypted with SHA- 1 hashing algorithm and then stored in database.

    Passwords are stored as encrypted hashes with an additional random salt for added security.

Note: If we talk about security,above mentioned points would provide no security at all but it will work for beginners. Being into web app pentesting,I very well know this project will not be considered secure. It needs atleast a more effective filtering mechanism, better hashing algorithm, a better salting procedure for storing passwords and some other things too.

Database:

    The database contains customer, staff & admin tables.

    Each customer has its own virtual passbook linked with its account number.

    Staff, customer and, admin have their details and password in their respective tables with all the details.

    A separate table for beneficiary is included in the database.

    A table for cheque book and ATM requests is included.

This project is divided into three hierarchical parts:

    The index page for the customer login.

    A hidden staff login page.

    A hidden admin login page.

Usage:

1.Install XAMPP or something similar.

2.Copy all the files to c:/xampp/htdocs/banking/

3.Create a db named as 'bank_db.sql' and import the bank_db.sql from phpMyAdmin.

4.change the password in _inc/dbconn.php file accordingly.

5.Add your gmail credential in the email.php file (where the comments are added)

6.visit localhost/banking/adminlogin.php (admin login) and add the the customer

7.Now visit localhost/banking register page with the login credential given by the admin and change the password acaccording to your wish.

8.Now login with the new password using either the colour based or grid based authentication.

9.visit localhost/banking/staff_login.php (staff login)

Note: The customer passwords are hashed and stored in the database. You will not be able to see it. The password is 'rash' for almost all the customers,just in case if you want to login with the pre added customer.
